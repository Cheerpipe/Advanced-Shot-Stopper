// BOUNDARY: These types are the ONLY machine vocabulary brew/stopper/guards
// may use. They must never branch on paddle vs switch, paddle-mode settings,
// or compiled machine identity. UserIntent is the product of the activator:
// the specialization reads ACTIVATOR_GPIO and translates that signal here.
// MachineSense is a one-way push from the stopper — specializations must not
// reach into session or live scale globals.

# Shot history

Automatic brew-by-weight shots with a connected scale are stored on the
controller and shown in the Web UI shot log. Use it to see why a shot ended
and how close it landed to the target.

## What is recorded

Only **automatic BBW** shots qualify: scale present at start, brew-by-weight
enabled (not timer-only), and automatic weight control active. Manual shots,
timer-only brews, and cycles without a scale are **not** stored.

Typical fields include local time (from the configured timezone offset),
duration, goal and actual weight, error, average flow, first-drop time,
whether Fast/Slow guards ran or extended the shot, `shot_type`, `cut_type`
(`auto`, `manual`, `limit`), `stop_detail` (for example
`normal_target`, `activator`, `web_stop`, `wall_limit`, `hard_limit`,
`extended_max_weight`, `cup_removed`), and a manual `rating` from 0
(unrated) to 5. Rate a finished shot from Home (Last/Current shot) or from
a history card by tapping a star; tapping the current star again clears the
score.

The log holds up to **120** shots. The following are never stored:

- Quick rinses and cycles shorter than 10 s
- Manual, timer-only, or no-scale shots
- Shots whose final weight is missing or below 1 g (e.g. scale off the
  machine or disconnected)

Those empty or sub-1 g shots are still shown on Home as the **last shot**
(status always reflects the current and last finished cycle). They are not
written to history, not used in averages, and not used for learned stop
offset or A→M samples.

Curve samples and the history record are written **once** when the cycle
closes (after the configured drip delay), not during an active brew. Shot
duration and the curve time axis end when the machine circuit opens. The
settled post-drip weight replaces the curve's endpoint at that same end time;
the drip-delay interval is not appended to the graph. The current-shot curve exposed to Home is an in-memory view; it is not a
persistent live-telemetry service.

## In the Web UI

Open the shot history table to browse rows, delete one entry, clear the
whole log, or export CSV. Clearing requires an explicit confirm.

Sort the list by **Date** or **Rating**, ascending or descending. Date
defaults to newest first. Rating puts unrated shots (0 stars) at the end
in both directions; equal scores keep newer shots first. The table loads
**10 shots at a time** as you scroll. The 20 s poll refreshes only the
first page of the current sort so new shots appear without re-downloading
the whole log. Export CSV fetches the full log newest-first in one
request, independent of the on-screen sort.

History averages (duration, weight, error, flow) use only **auto** shots
with actual weight at least 1 g from the last 10 stored entries, even
when the list is sorted by rating or oldest-first.

## Read a result

| Stop detail | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `normal_target` | Normal weight endpoint, including offset/prediction |
| `extended_max_weight` / `extended_min_time` | Fast guard extended the shot |
| `slow_max_time` / `slow_min_weight` | Slow guard reached its recovery boundary |
| `auto_to_manual` | Scale-loss time guard |
| `activator` / `web_stop` | Physical / authenticated Web stop |
| `wall_limit` / `hard_limit` | Operational / hard time limit |
| `cup_removed` | Cup-removal protection requested stop |

For example, 39 g against a 36 g goal with a Fast stop detail is not the same
calibration problem as a normal target cut followed by excess drip. Check the
reason before resetting learned offset. A 2 s cycle shown on Home is excluded
from persistent history; an unrated shot uses rating 0.

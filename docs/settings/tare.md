# Tare

Four controls distinguish cup-placement tare outside a brew, optional accessory
retare while idle, shot-start tare, and late-cup retare. Machine-level, under
**Settings → Machine and scale → Tare**, except **BBW protection**, which is
on the active brew preset.

Initial weight-stop protection is a separate brew setting; its range and
interactions are in [Cup protection](../features/cup-protection.md).

Together with [Cup](cup.md), this is the setting side of
[Tare and retare](../features/tare-retare.md) and
[Cup protection](../features/cup-protection.md).

## When it applies

Initial tare and timer commands can also run on timer-only shots with a usable
scale. Late retare and BBW protection apply to automatic BBW, not timer-only or
manual no-scale cycles. Shot **Post-tare grace** is inactive when **Automatic tare at shot start**
is off.

First-drop / first-flow detection still runs against the tare zero even while
the grace window is open. A small stream of coffee does not wait for the
scale to settle. Placing the cup (including overshoot around 150–200 g) or a
finger tap is not first drop and does not block retare.

For a cup placed after the retare window, stop and restart correctly; the
controller does not promise another automatic tare outside that window.

## Parameters

| Setting | Default | Range | Effect on the shot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Automatic tare outside a brew** | ON | ON / OFF | Tare once on a new stable cup placement while idle, independently of shot-start tare, BBW, and cup protection. Never tares merely because a shot ends. |
| **Retare when adding or removing an accessory** | ON | ON / OFF | Before brewing, tare a stable added load on a cup already tared outside a brew, then retare its known removal while the cup remains. Requires **Automatic tare outside a brew**. |
| **Automatic tare at shot start** | ON | ON / OFF | Tare at shot start when a usable scale supports it, including timer-only shots. |
| **Post-tare grace (s)** | 2 s | 0.5–10 s | After a tare (start or late-cup retare), wait this long for ~0 g before using weight for **stop/control**. |
| **Late-cup retare during a shot** | ON | ON / OFF | Allow one late-cup retare during the retare window. Requires shot-start tare and fires on the cup-presence **placed** event. |
| **Retare window (s)** | 4 s | 0.5–10 s | Time after shot start to detect and retare a late-placed cup. |
| **Bookoo combined command** | ON | ON / OFF | Use the scale’s combined tare + start-timer command at shot start. Requires shot-start tare. Idle tare never starts the timer. Bookoo only. |

All tare switches are shared machine settings, not preset values. Save changes
while idle. **Automatic tare outside a brew** defaults ON on first setup, factory
reset, and upgrade from a configuration without this field. A saved OFF value
survives reboot and later upgrades. Enabling it with a cup already present does
not tare that cup. Accessory retare defaults ON after installation or factory
reset; its saved OFF value survives reboot and firmware upgrades. Turning it on
for an already-tared cup takes effect with the next cup placement and
controller-confirmed tare.

## Outside a brew

After connection, let the controller observe a stable empty pan near zero,
then place the cup. A single absent sample cannot authorize idle tare.
The existing [Cup](cup.md) stability settings qualify the placement and the empty
reference. Once that reference is known, a
[qualified brief unload](cup.md#fast-replacement-outside-a-shot) followed by stable
placement also works without another stable-empty pause.
Either placement path triggers another tare, even if the cup contains coffee.
With accessory retare OFF, adding coffee or a spoon while the cup stays present
does not tare.

With **Retare when adding or removing an accessory** ON, place and let the cup
auto-tare first. Add the accessory before starting the shot, then wait for its
added weight to meet **Minimum cup weight** and the configured stability window.
The controller tares that addition once; the cup remains present and its
calculated load includes the accessory. If you then remove that accessory before
brewing, a matching stable weight drop triggers another tare while the cup stays
present. You can add the accessory again after that removal. A second addition
without an intervening known removal, or any change during or after its shot,
does not trigger this option. Because the scale reports weight
rather than what was added, a stable addition of coffee can also be tared.
Leave this option OFF if you put ingredients in the cup before brewing.
Disconnected, stale, uncertain, or interrupted readings cannot authorize it.

When the cup and accessory were placed together, the controller knows only their
combined weight. Removing one part cannot be identified reliably, so it does
not retare that partial drop. Remove everything, let the empty pan settle, and
place the cup again to resume automatic tare. If the separately measured cup
and accessory have nearly equal weights, their individual removal is also
ambiguous and does not trigger accessory retare. A failed or unconfirmed tare
may require a diagnostic tare with the pan empty before automatic placement
can resume.

Moving an empty scale and returning it near its original zero does not authorize
an idle tare. Before the first cup, a small stable negative offset can become
the empty reference. A larger negative reading first seen at boot/reconnect,
without a preceding qualified zero and continuous unload, requires an empty-pan
firmware diagnostic tare and stable zero; see [Cup](cup.md).

The machine must be confirmed off. A new placement can tare after a normal
shot stop while the paddle is still ON; the paddle still must be released before
another shot. Rinse, active shots, uncertain stop state, safety failures, and
maintenance exclude idle tare. An excluded placement is not replayed later.

A cup detected before tare remains present at 0 g and satisfies **Require cup
to start**. Other start protections still apply. Boot/reconnect loses presence
evidence. With a cup already reading a positive weight, remove it, let the empty
pan settle near zero, and replace it. If the Bookoo zeroed a cup already on its
pan at power-on, let that zero settle first, then remove the cup. A continuous,
stable negative reading can establish the empty reference; placing a cup with a
different weight can then trigger tare. A return near the original zero is
treated as possible empty-scale movement. For an equal-weight replacement, a
reading gap, or a negative reading first seen at connection, tare the empty pan
from **Diagnostic**, wait for stable zero, then place the cup.
The integrated protocols currently do not report a verifiable physical-button
tare event; a zero reading alone cannot distinguish that action from returning
to the previous displayed weight. **Tared** on Home describes the controller's
last known cup state, not proof that the physical button was or was not pressed.
If you press the scale's button after removing the cup, tare the empty pan from
**Diagnostic**, let zero settle, and place the cup again. Accessory retare does
not resolve this ambiguity.

An accepted physical shot or Quick rinse start takes priority over a pending
idle tare; use the normal paddle or button gesture without releasing and
retrying. A queued idle tare is canceled, while a scale write already in
progress may finish. A shot starts its internal timer and sends its normal
shot-start timer and tare command. The older idle result stays separate from
the new cycle and cannot trigger a late retare or replace its baseline.
No-scale, cup, maintenance, and safety protections still block starts normally.

Queued requests expire after 1 s. An executing write stays serialized until it
returns, and its result is cleaned up within the 1 s write allowance plus the
configured post-tare grace. Failed requests are not automatically retried on a
cup that remains present.
If an accessory is added or removed but returned to the previous zero before
its queued tare is written, that cancelled change can be tried again on the
same cup. A failed or unconfirmed scale write still needs fresh reference
evidence; merely returning to zero does not retry it.

Before an idle write starts, fresh readings must still satisfy the configured
minimum using the original direct/relative reference and the placement stability
window. A changed or stale placement cancels the queued request;
remove and replace the cup to authorize another attempt. An executing write
keeps its ownership until it returns, even if the cup is removed or settings
change.

Write success alone does not confirm the cup's zero reference. The controller
checks notification capture order against the write boundary, including zero
readings received during the write. Buffered pre-write readings cannot confirm
the effect. If the bounded settling period ends without it, a fresh unchanged
reference is retained; otherwise the reference becomes uncertain and cannot
satisfy **Require cup to start**. A later unambiguous lift/replacement or a new
connection can establish fresh evidence; a zero alone cannot reconstruct
physical motion hidden by simultaneous tare.

Tracked tares translate the known empty reference from the latest control-approved
reading captured immediately before the write, rather than the enqueue weight.
An idle request waits for control to approve any readings collected at the final
pre-write check, within its original expiry. Contradictory evidence cancels it.
Other tracked tares invalidate the anchor and cup mass when that evidence is
missing; they do not fabricate a new empty zero.

**Home → Cup → Automatic tare** shows whether the empty pan must settle, the
controller is ready for a cup, the machine must turn off, tare is pending, or the
cup needs removal and replacement. An uncertain reference asks for a diagnostic
tare with the pan empty. **Stale**, **No sample**, and **Disconnected** take
precedence when scale data is unavailable. A smoothly displayed weight does not
prove a qualifying placement: a gap longer than **Max sample gap** also requires
fresh removal/placement evidence. After a successful tare, the message stays
**Tared** while that cup remains present.

Debug export schema 1 includes `idleTare`: request/placement IDs, eligibility
and terminal reasons, reference confidence, qualifying weight range, capture
and command times, sequence boundary, and dropped/rejected sample counts.
These fields come from the control snapshot. `effect_unconfirmed`, `unstable`,
`stale_sample`, `sample_gap`, and `removed` distinguish common incomplete
attempts. `qualificationMinG`/`qualificationMaxG` describe the observed window,
not configured minimum/maximum cup mass. `requestPlacementId` identifies the
originating placement even after a different cup replaces it. No periodic retry
is performed.

Both Home and full Web status payloads additionally expose `cupPresence.idleTare`
as a presentation code: `empty`, `ready`, `pending`, `tared`, `remove`,
`retry`, `uncertain`, or the existing eligibility reason. It is derived from the
same control snapshot; it neither authorizes commands nor changes the separate
integration API. Clients must also check scale availability and stream state.

## Example

Shot-start tare is on, grace 2 s, retare window 4 s. The shot starts, the
scale tares, then you place the cup at 2 s. A second tare fires. Weight stop
still waits for BBW protection (default 12 s) so the cup weight cannot cut
the shot.

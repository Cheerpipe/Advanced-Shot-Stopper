# Scales

Finding a compatible, connectable scale pauses outbound cloud calls, webhooks
and time synchronization before Bluetooth setup begins. They resume after the
scale is ready and its quiet interval has ended. If it disappears, the controller
waits for five seconds of actual scanning without another candidate. This also
applies to machine profiles without Micra integration. Wi-Fi stays connected
and local settings remain accessible.

Which Bluetooth scale to use, how long to wait after a shot for drip, and
Bookoo-specific volume / combined tare. Machine-level, under
**Settings → Machine and scale → Scales**.

Daily defaults assume a **Bookoo** Themis Mini or Ultra. **Acaia**,
**Felicita**, **AtomHeart Eclair**, **Decent**, **DiFluid Microbalance**,
**MyScale**, **Varia AKU**, **Eureka Precisa** (named GAP), and **WeighMyBru**
are also supported through the vendored EspressoScaleBLE library. Compatibility
details:
[Scale compatibility](../../libraries/EspressoScaleBLE/README.md#scale-compatibility).

Timemore Black Mirror DUO, Timemore Dot, Acaia Umbra, and Eureka units that
advertise no GAP name are not supported.

This controller connects to scales without authenticated Bluetooth pairing. Use
weight-controlled brewing where nearby Bluetooth devices are trusted: a compatible
transmitter could send misleading weight readings. The machine still requires
a physical start, and implausible or stale readings suspend weight control.

## Rename a scale

Scales broadcast names such as `BOOKOO_SC 715097`; you may still want to
distinguish two scales of the same model. Next
to the preferred scale on **Home**, on **Diagnostic → Connected scale**, and beside
**Preferred scale** in **Settings → Scales** — where the link follows the
scale chosen in the dropdown, so you can rename any remembered scale, not
just the one that is connected — choose **(rename)** to give that scale your
own name, for example `Espresso corner scale`. Your name replaces the
broadcast name everywhere the scale is listed — Home, Diagnostic, and the
preferred-scale list in Settings — and stays with that scale across restarts.
Any remembered scale can have its own name, whether or not it is preferred.
Diagnostic shows the name of the scale connected now, or **Not connected** when
there is no connection. Home continues to show the saved preferred scale.

Bookoo Themis models identify themselves in that broadcast name, so the
scale library proposes a readable model name for you: a scale broadcasting
`BOOKOO_SC` with digits appears as **BOOKOO Themis Mini**, and one
broadcasting `BOOKOO_SC U` with digits appears as **BOOKOO Themis Ultra**.
The proposed name appears when the scale is first detected and added to the
list, and keeps working after a restart. A name you choose always takes
precedence.

Use up to 30 letters, numbers, spaces, or hyphens. Saving with an empty text
field returns to the proposed model name, or to the broadcast name when the
model is unknown. Renaming is unavailable while a shot is
running.

## Bluetooth on/off

**Admin → BLE → Enable Bluetooth** is the master switch for Bluetooth scales.
It is the first group on the Admin page and defaults to **on**. The switch
only takes effect when you press the group's **Save settings** button; the
arrow button beside it discards the change and restores the saved position.

- **On** (default): scales are searched for and connected exactly as always.
- **Off**: searching stops and any connected scale is disconnected within a
  moment. No new scale can connect until the switch is turned back on.

With the switch off, the controller behaves exactly as if no scale existed:
brew by weight falls back to the behavior described in
[No-scale BBW](no-scale-bbw.md), and reconnecting after enabling again takes
a few seconds because the controller honors the standard quiet period that
follows every scale disconnect. The setting changes nothing else — scan mode,
preferred scale, history, and every other setting keep their own values, and
turning Bluetooth back on restores normal operation without a restart.

## Scale power-off support

**Turn scale off when the machine powers off**
([La Marzocco Linea Micra](linea-micra.md#turn-scale-off-when-the-machine-powers-off))
switches the connected scale off over Bluetooth, but only when the scale
itself accepts a power-off command. The explicit support list:

| Scale | Power-off over Bluetooth |
| --- | --- |
| Bookoo Themis Ultra | Yes — BooKoo's published protocol, command `0x15`; may be ignored while charging |
| Bookoo Themis Mini | No — BooKoo's published protocol for the Mini has no shutdown command |
| Acaia (Lunar, Pearl S, Pyxis, Cinco, Proch) | No — no power-off command is documented for the Acaia protocol |
| Felicita (Arc) | No |
| AtomHeart Eclair | No |
| Decent Scale | No |
| DiFluid Microbalance / Ti | No |
| MyScale KP2048B | No |
| Varia AKU / Mini / Pro | No |
| Eureka Precisa | No |
| WeighMyBru | No |

When the broadcast name identifies a Themis Mini, the controller skips the
shutdown command and records a warning. It sends shutdown to a recognized
Ultra. If a Bookoo broadcast does not reveal the model, the controller keeps
the existing generic Bookoo behavior, so shutdown may be attempted. Other
scales without power-off support receive no shutdown command. Scale support
assumes the current manufacturer firmware.

For Bookoo, the controller leaves at least 100 ms between Bluetooth commands.
Once it asks the scale to shut down, it sends no more commands on that
connection. The BLE library blocks commands, reads, scanning, and reconnection
for 3,000 ms, starting before the shutdown command and restarting the full
interval as soon as the scale's disconnect is observed. The first valid
advertisement after that quiet period can reconnect normally, once the previous
connection has fully closed. If a command times out during shutdown, the
controller waits for the old connection to close before searching again; a
delayed disconnect starts a fresh three-second pause.

## Manual tare for diagnosis

With a Bookoo connected and the controller **Ready**, use **Diagnostic → Scale
→ Tare** to request one standalone tare. It zeroes the scale without starting
or resetting its timer, changing volume, or sending another scale command.
The button is unavailable during a cycle. For an isolated test, turn off
automatic tare outside a brew and late-cup retare beforehand; this button does
not change those settings. **Tare requested** confirms the request was queued;
check the scale's reading and diagnostic log for its result.

**Diagnostic → Scale → Supported commands** lists the commands implemented for
the connected, identified Bookoo model in a two-column table, with command names
on the left and their hexadecimal codes on the right.
When the model is unknown or another brand is connected, the page says that
command support is unknown. The Ultra's power-off command can be ignored while
the scale is charging.

## When it applies

A usable scale is required for automatic brew-by-weight. If the scale is
missing, see [No-scale BBW](no-scale-bbw.md). If it drops mid-shot, see
[A→M time guard](../features/auto-to-manual.md).

**Drip delay** runs after machine circuit opens. It is used for Last Shot, history,
offset learning, and eligible A→M samples.

## Parameters

| Setting | Default | Range / notes | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scale preference** | Prefer selected | First available / Prefer selected / Preferred only | **First available** connects whichever compatible scale appears first and never locks it. **Prefer selected** waits briefly for the preferred scale, then accepts another. **Preferred only** connects only to the saved preferred scale. If either selected mode has no saved scale yet, it uses the bootstrap flow below. |
| **Preferred scale** | First detected | First detected, No preferred, or a BLE-seen scale | **First detected** is shown only while no preferred MAC is saved and **Prefer selected** or **Preferred only** is active. The controller scans by compatible name and adopts the first scale that completes a successful connection; advertisements and failed connections are not enough. **First available** instead shows **No preferred** because that mode never locks a scale. **Clear preferred** pauses discovery for 30 s, keeps history, and keeps the current Scale preference. |
| **Drip delay (s)** | 3.0 s | 0–10 s | Wait after a shot ends before capturing the final post-drip weight. `0` finalizes on the next control loop with no intentional window. |
| **Timer stop extra delay (ms)** | 0 ms | 0–1000 ms | Pad after the scale timer catches up to circuit whole seconds, before `STOP_TIMER`. `0` stops in that same instant. Does not delay the local machine circuit beep. |
| **Bookoo combined command** | ON | ON / OFF | Combined tare + start-timer. Requires automatic tare at shot start. Also listed under [Tare](tare.md). |
| **Mute scale in Buzzer only** | ON | ON / OFF | Bookoo/generic: send silence (volume 0) after the first valid weight on the first connection of that scale in this Open Brew by Weight session. Reconnecting does not resend it. Applies only in **Buzzer only**. |
| **Scale volume** | 3 | 1–5 or Disabled | Bookoo/generic: set after the first valid weight on the first connection of that scale in this Open Brew by Weight session. Mini accepts levels 1–5; Ultra accepts 1–3. **Disabled** sends volume 0. A previously saved 4 or 5 remains saved but is skipped with a warning on a recognized Ultra. Reconnecting does not resend it. Changes that alter the effective speaker volume also apply to a stable link; saving unrelated settings does not resend the command. Applies only in **Scale only** and **Scale priority**. |
| **AtomHeart Eclair** | informational | — | Uses normal tare/timer commands. No configurable volume, beep, mode, combined command, or documented command sound. In Buzzer only and Scale priority, alerts use the local buzzer; Scale only omits unsupported sounds. |

If the scale disconnects or **notifications go silent** during an automatic
extraction, weight control is suspended. Rejected brew samples (post-tare,
slew) and a stable accepted weight do not count as a lost scale. Recovery
needs three coherent samples on the current connection. Physical stop behavior depends on the selected switch/mode; applicable time
limits remain in force.

## Example

The integrated scale protocols expose weight/timer readings and firmware
command results, but no verified physical-button tare notification. Preserving
a cup at zero after such a button press is therefore not supported by the
current integration; weight alone cannot distinguish it from cup removal.
Firmware idle tare preserves the known cup reference. See [Tare](tare.md).

On a new controller, **Prefer selected** and **First detected** are selected.
Turn on your Bookoo: after its first successful connection, its MAC and name
replace **First detected** and are saved. From then on, the controller waits
briefly for that scale before accepting another compatible one. After each shot, the firmware
waits 3 s of drip before storing the final weight used for offset learning.
Bookoo volume is not rewritten on reconnections during the same controller
session. Restarting the controller or explicitly clearing that preferred
scale opens a new first-connection session for it.

If no compatible scale is available, the controller stays in the bootstrap
name scan indefinitely and does not silently change the saved preference.
Choosing **Prefer selected** before a scale has been adopted uses the same
bootstrap; after adoption, its normal preferred-first fallback applies.
Changing the preference mode or selected scale restarts an in-progress search
immediately with the new filter. If **Preferred only** is enabled while a
different scale is connected, that connection is closed before directed
discovery begins.

If you cancel a connection just as it completes, the controller closes that
connection before starting another search. It waits for Bluetooth to confirm
the closure; if searching remains stuck because that confirmation never
arrives, restart the controller.

If a visible scale repeatedly refuses a Bluetooth connection, the first few
attempts remain quick and later attempts spread out, up to five seconds apart.
The controller keeps trying automatically; fresh weight after a healthy
connection restores the quick initial timing. A scale that stops advertising
does not trigger blind connection attempts.

With INFO serial logging enabled, `ble tx` shows each submitted Bluetooth
command once, with its name and hexadecimal bytes. For commands, `command done`
reports the result and elapsed time; `gap_ms` shows how long it has been since
the previous command. A result with `submitted=0` means the command was not
sent. The scale address is not included.

## Replace a scale or diagnose a missing connection

Home distinguishes **No sample** (connected but no accepted weight yet), **Stale**
(last weight too old), and **Disconnected**. A saved scale name or last displayed
weight does not prove the connection is usable. The first valid packet has a
5 s deadline; Bookoo disconnects after 8 s without valid packets. Automation
rejects readings older than 1 s, before that link timeout. Check
**Cup → Automatic tare** for the separate placement/readiness requirements.

1. Turn off other compatible scales and close phone apps connected to the one
   you want.
2. Select the intended remembered scale, or **Clear preferred** for a new one.
   Clearing pauses discovery for 30 s; it does not erase scale history.
3. With **Preferred only** and no saved preference, let the intended scale
   complete its first connection. Check Home for fresh weight, not just a name.
4. If discovery is slow, check **Admin → Power management → BLE scan mode**:
   factory **Balanced**, with **Aggressive** searching harder and **Relaxed**
   trading some speed for less radio time. Optional
   [Power management](power-management.md) temporarily uses Relaxed in
   idle; switching it off restores the saved mode. Below it, **Idle scan
   backoff** chooses how long to search at full strength with no scale in
   range before slowing down to save power — factory default **OFF** means
   this backoff itself never slows the search (the Power policy above can
   still use Relaxed while the machine sits idle), and with Aggressive or
   Balanced the first sign of a scale restores the saved mode on its own. **Scan boost on machine use**
   is the inverse safety net for people who leave the backoff on: switching
   on the machine with no scale connected searches at Aggressive for the
   chosen minutes (factory default **15 minutes**), overriding both slowdowns.

## Recording what the scale reports

When a scale misbehaves in a way settings cannot explain, the diagnostic page
can record a trace of everything the scale sends and every tare, cup,
touch, and first-drop decision that follows. See
[the diagnostic guide](../FAQ.md)
for how to start, stop, and download the recording. Capture lasts until its
recording space fills or you stop it; the page shows capacity used, elapsed
time, and a smoothed estimate of time remaining based on the arriving data.

Use **Diagnostic → Scale profiling** to investigate unexpected cup detection,
tare, or weight-controlled brewing. Start a capture, reproduce the behavior,
stop the capture, and download the text file. For example, start with an empty
pan, place a cup, wait for automatic tare, then lift the cup again.

The recording includes received weights and the controller's interpretation:
cup placement/removal, waiting for the pan or cup to settle, readiness for a
cup, tare requests and results, uncertain references, and related brewing
states. A successful tare command and a confirmed zero are separate events.
Waiting or blocked states include reasons where the controller knows them.

You can start while an operation is already underway. The first observation
establishes its current state; later entries record changes without repeating
unchanged states. The recording cannot recover events that happened before
you started it. Cup events describe what the controller detected from the
weight, rather than an independent measurement of the physical cup.

A capture can also stop when its buffer fills. A busy session fills it sooner
because weights and state changes share that space. Check the stop reason and
lost-record count before treating a trace as complete. Completed captures are
saved when safe and survive a restart; the download indicates whether saving
has completed. Starting another capture replaces the previous one.

# Scales

Which Bluetooth scale to use, how long to wait after a shot for drip, and
Bookoo-specific volume / combined tare. Machine-level, under
**Settings → Machine and scale → Scales**.

Daily defaults assume a **Bookoo** Themis Mini or Ultra. **Acaia**,
**Felicita**, **AtomHeart Eclair**, **Decent**, **DiFluid Microbalance**,
**MyScale**, **Varia AKU**, **Eureka Precisa** (named GAP), and **WeighMyBru**
are also supported through the vendored EspressoScaleBLE library. Compatibility
details:
[Scale compatibility](../../libraries/EspressoScaleBLE/README.md#scale-compatibility).

Timemore Black Mirror DUO, Timemore Dot, Acaia Umbra, and Eureka units that
advertise no GAP name are not supported.

## When it applies

A usable scale is required for automatic brew-by-weight. If the scale is
missing, see [No-scale BBW](no-scale-bbw.md). If it drops mid-shot, see
[A→M time guard](../features/auto-to-manual.md).

**Drip delay** runs after machine circuit opens. It is used for Last Shot, history,
offset learning, and eligible A→M samples.

## Parameters

| Setting | Default | Range / notes | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scale preference** | Preferred only | First available / Prefer selected / Preferred only | **First available** connects whichever compatible scale appears first and never locks it. **Prefer selected** waits briefly for the preferred scale, then accepts another. **Preferred only** connects only to the saved preferred scale. If either selected mode has no saved scale yet, it uses the bootstrap flow below. |
| **Preferred scale** | First detected | First detected, No preferred, or a BLE-seen scale | **First detected** is shown only while no preferred MAC is saved and **Prefer selected** or **Preferred only** is active. The controller scans by compatible name and adopts the first scale that completes a successful connection; advertisements and failed connections are not enough. **First available** instead shows **No preferred** because that mode never locks a scale. **Clear preferred** pauses discovery for 30 s, keeps history, and keeps the current Scale preference. |
| **Drip delay (s)** | 3.0 s | 0–10 s | Wait after a shot ends before capturing the final post-drip weight. `0` finalizes on the next control loop with no intentional window. |
| **Timer stop extra delay (ms)** | 0 ms | 0–1000 ms | Pad after the scale timer catches up to circuit whole seconds, before `STOP_TIMER`. `0` stops in that same instant. Does not delay the local machine circuit beep. |
| **Bookoo combined command** | ON | ON / OFF | Combined tare + start-timer. Requires automatic tare. Also listed under [Tare](tare.md). |
| **Mute scale in Buzzer only** | ON | ON / OFF | Bookoo/generic: send silence (volume 0) after the first valid weight on the first connection of that scale in this Shot Stopper session. Reconnecting does not resend it. Applies only in **Buzzer only**. |
| **Scale volume** | 4 | 1–5 or Disabled | Bookoo/generic: set after the first valid weight on the first connection of that scale in this Shot Stopper session. Reconnecting does not resend it. Explicit setting changes still apply to a stable link. Applies only in **Scale only** and **Scale priority**. |
| **AtomHeart Eclair** | informational | — | Uses normal tare/timer commands. No configurable volume, beep, mode, combined command, or documented command sound. In Buzzer only and Scale priority, alerts use the local buzzer; Scale only omits unsupported sounds. |

If the scale disconnects or **notifications go silent** during an automatic
extraction, weight control is suspended. Rejected brew samples (post-tare,
slew) and a stable accepted weight do not count as a lost scale. Recovery
needs three coherent samples on the current connection. Paddle OFF and time
limits remain in force.

## Example

On a new controller, **Preferred only** and **First detected** are selected.
Turn on your Bookoo: after its first successful connection, its MAC and name
replace **First detected** and are saved. From then on, other scales may be
remembered in history but are not connected. After each shot, the firmware
waits 3 s of drip before storing the final weight used for offset learning.
Bookoo volume is not rewritten on reconnections during the same controller
session. Restarting the Shot Stopper or explicitly clearing that preferred
scale opens a new first-connection session for it.

If no compatible scale is available, the controller stays in the bootstrap
name scan indefinitely and does not silently change the saved preference.
Choosing **Prefer selected** before a scale has been adopted uses the same
bootstrap; after adoption, its normal preferred-first fallback applies.
Changing the preference mode or selected scale restarts an in-progress search
immediately with the new filter. If **Preferred only** is enabled while a
different scale is connected, that connection is closed before directed
discovery begins.

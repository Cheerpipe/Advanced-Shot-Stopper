## Developer map

Start with [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the applicable `AGENTS.md`.
Temporary working files live in Git-ignored `temp/` inside the local project.
Development plans live in Git-ignored `docs/plans/`, and audits in Git-ignored
`docs/audits/`. Each plan or audit is its own progress record and session handoff.
Their contents are not onboarding or background context: read them only when the
user explicitly requests reading or working with a plan or audit. See the
[record access rule](AI_WORKFLOW.md#explicit-access-to-plans-and-audits).
See the [shared format and recovery procedure](AI_WORKFLOW.md#plans-audits-and-session-handoff).
All three directories belong to the local project and remain accessible from
the IDE; see [local storage and Git](AI_WORKFLOW.md#local-project-files-and-git).
Use [documentation maintenance](AI_WORKFLOW.md#documentation-maintenance) to
identify which guides to update when settings, scripts, or behavior change.
The map below identifies the smallest relevant sources and tests.
`./scripts/dev context <area>` lists focused paths, not file contents; supported
areas are safety, control, machine, scale, ble, network, ota, persistence, web,
build, and tests. There is no `docs` area.

File names in the table are relative to this directory unless a source path
or root policy is named. Commands are starting points, not substitutes for the
risk gate in [VALIDATION.md](../VALIDATION.md).

## Repository boundaries

- Canonical firmware: `src/`; Web source: `src/web/`; BLE library:
  `libraries/EspressoScaleBLE/`; ESP-IDF integration: `idf/`.
- Generated: `src/ShotStopperVersion.h`,
  `src/ShotStopperWebAssetsGzip.h`, build trees, reports, and `artifacts/`.
- Local plans: `docs/plans/`; local audits: `docs/audits/`. Both are retained
  locally, excluded from Git, and serve as their own session handoffs.
- Local temporary working files: `temp/`, inside the project and excluded from
  Git. Keep task-specific files accessible from the IDE; Git exclusion does not
  mean storing files outside the project.
- Vendored/dependency output: `idf/managed_components/` and `node_modules/`.
  Do not review or load these trees unless dependency provenance itself is the
  task. Lockfiles and IDF configuration remain visible and reviewable.
- Current safety authority is the charter, validation policy, architecture
  documents, and manual test plan.

## Key policies

- [Project charter](../PROJECT_CHARTER.md)
- [Validation gates](../VALIDATION.md)
- [Contribution workflow](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [AI workflow](AI_WORKFLOW.md)
- [Build](BUILD.md) and [script reference](SCRIPTS.md)
- [Manual test plan](MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md)

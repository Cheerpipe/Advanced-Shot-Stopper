# Hardware

Development board used for this firmware, default GPIO map, and wiring
warnings.

**TODO:** bill of materials, schematic, and step-by-step brew-switch wiring.

On the Linea Micra, the intercepted brew-switch connector is labelled **CN9**.
This firmware treats that contact as the **machine circuit** — the isolated
path that makes the machine run — not as a Micra-specific name. Other machines
intercept a different brew/run circuit with the same relay contract. User-facing
copy (Web UI, Settings, status JSON) always says **machine circuit**, never CN9.

Until that write-up exists, treat the photo and pin table below as the known
facts, and complete the [manual test plan](MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md) on the bench
before connecting a live machine.

## Development board

Firmware was developed on an **ESP32-S3 1-channel relay** board (WROOM-1
**N16R8** module: 16 MB flash, 8 MB OPI PSRAM, USB-C, onboard Songle relay
with COM / NO / NC screw terminals). Product listing used for development:
[ESP32-S3 1-channel relay (AliExpress)](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005011880181624.html).

### Front

### Back

The firmware **default GPIO map matches this board**. It is not a generic
DevKit pinout.

You can still compile for **n8r4** (8 MB flash, 4 MB QSPI PSRAM) if that is
the module you have. Paddle and relay GPIOs stay the same; only flash size
and PSRAM type change. Classic ESP32 and Arduino Nano ESP32 are **not
supported**.

## 3D-printable enclosure

A simple two-part enclosure is provided for the ESP32-S3 relay development
board. It can be printed in **PLA**; **PET** is preferred for a more durable,
heat-resistant installation.

- [`AdvancedShotStopper-Box.stl`](../stl/AdvancedShotStopper-Box.stl) — the
  main box that houses the development board.
- [`AdvancedShotStopper-Cover.stl`](../stl/AdvancedShotStopper-Cover.stl) —
  the open/partial top cover for the box.

Example of the assembled, printed enclosure:

Pins live in [`src/ShotStopperHardware.h`](../src/ShotStopperHardware.h).
They are **not** editable from the Web UI.

## Default GPIOs

| Function | GPIO | Level |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Activator (to GND) | **21** | Active **LOW** (internal pull-up; ON = GPIO LOW). Paddle or switch, depending on machine type. |
| Reed (momentary+reed builds) | **13** | Active **LOW** (internal pull-up; ON = GPIO LOW). Compile `SHOT_STOPPER_MACHINE_TYPE=2`. Override with `-DSHOT_STOPPER_REED_GPIO`. Must stay distinct from activator, relay, LED, buzzer, USB console, and safety GPIOs. |
| Onboard relay coil | **2** | Active **HIGH** (HIGH energizes the coil and closes NO) |
| Scale-connected LED | **1** | Active HIGH while a BLE scale is connected (switchable in Alerts) |
| Optional buzzer | **14** | Compile with `SHOT_STOPPER_ENABLE_BUZZER=1` (passive piezo, RTTTL). `=0` omits the local buzzer. |
| USB console jumper | **4** | Active **LOW**. Dupont **IO4 → a GND pad you choose**. Sampled once at boot. **Do not** jumper IO4 to **EN** (that column is reset). Override with `-DSHOT_STOPPER_USB_CONSOLE_GPIO`. Must stay distinct from activator, relay, LED, buzzer, reed, and safety GPIOs. |

Optional external K2 safety (both pins or neither; no defaults, because they
depend on a reviewed board):

- `SHOT_STOPPER_SAFETY_HEARTBEAT_GPIO`
- `SHOT_STOPPER_CIRCUIT_FEEDBACK_GPIO`
- `SHOT_STOPPER_CIRCUIT_FEEDBACK_CLOSED_LEVEL` (optional; default LOW)

Compile example (GPIO overrides). Add
`-DSHOT_STOPPER_ENABLE_REMOTE_MACHINE_CONTROL=1` only for an explicit
opt-in remote-control development build; default firmware leaves start/rinse
on the physical activator:

```sh
./scripts/build-idf --arch n16r8 \
  --flags "-DSHOT_STOPPER_SAFETY_HEARTBEAT_GPIO=16 -DSHOT_STOPPER_CIRCUIT_FEEDBACK_GPIO=17"
```

To use a different paddle, relay, LED, buzzer, or USB-console pin, edit
`ShotStopperHardware.h` (or the matching `-D` override) and rebuild. Wrong
pins can leave machine circuit closed or misread the paddle.

## USB console jumper

App USB CDC is **off** unless GPIO 4 is held LOW at reset (Dupont to GND),
or the firmware was compiled with `-DSHOT_STOPPER_ENABLE_JTAG=1`. Leave the
pin floating when the stopper is inside the machine. Pull the Dupont
**before** installing.

- **With jumper at reset (default firmware):** `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` /
  `/dev/ttyACM*` appears; [USB serial CLI](SERIAL_CLI.md) and `monitor-idf`
  work.
- **JTAG build (`-DSHOT_STOPPER_ENABLE_JTAG=1`):** USB Serial/JTAG is on at
  boot (OpenOCD + CDC) with no jumper. Do not ship this to a machine build.
- **Without jumper, default app running:** no CDC port. Flash with
  **BOOT + RST** (ROM USB download) or **OTA**.
- ROM download always works, jumper or not. On this board IO4 sits next to
  **EN** — never short that pair.

## Isolation (must)

- The machine circuit connects only to the relay **COM/NO** contact. Never to GND, VCC, or an
  ESP32 GPIO.
- Do not use NC as the brew path.
- Feedback, if you add it, must also be isolated. Do not join machine circuit ground to
  ESP32 ground.
- The onboard relay is **not** a certified safety barrier. A welded contact
  or a shorted driver needs a second, normally-open contact (K2) driven by an
  independent heartbeat. Without that, protection is software-only.

Verify continuity, module polarity, and that the relay stays **open** during
startup, reset, and power loss.

## Scale-connected LED

GPIO 1 is HIGH while a BLE scale is connected and **Settings → Alerts → Blue
LED while scale connected** is on. It is diagnostic only and is never part of
the machine-circuit decision.

Override at compile time with `-DSHOT_STOPPER_SCALE_CONNECTED_LED_GPIO=…`.
The pin must be output-capable and distinct from paddle, relay, buzzer,
heartbeat, and feedback.

## Local buzzer

Wire a **passive** 3.3 V piezo/speaker to `SHOT_STOPPER_BUZZER_GPIO` (default
14). The firmware drives it with PWM (RTTTL melodies), so it must be
**passive, not active**. A module with three pins — **GND**, **VCC** and
**IN** — is preferred over a loose two-wire speaker: connect GND to GND, VCC
to 3.3 V, and IN to the buzzer GPIO. For a two-wire passive piezo, connect
the marked **+** to the GPIO and the other lead to GND.

Example used: [3.3 V passive buzzer module (AliExpress)](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005007287329656.html).

`SHOT_STOPPER_ENABLE_BUZZER=0` omits the driver. See [Alerts](alerts.md) and
[Build environment](BUILD.md).

## Additional hardware used

### Reed switch (optional, strongly recommended for momentary machines)

The reed switch is optional, but is strongly recommended for momentary-button
machines such as the **Rancilio Silvia Pro X**. Without it, firmware combines
its internal state machine with scale readings to infer whether the machine is
running. With a reed switch on the solenoid, it reads the machine state
directly, which is substantially more reliable and precise.

Use it with the momentary+reed build (`SHOT_STOPPER_MACHINE_TYPE=2`); the
default input is GPIO 13, as documented in [Default GPIOs](#default-gpios).
It is generally unnecessary for latch/paddle machines such as the **Linea
Micra**.

Example used: [reed switch sensor module (AliExpress)](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005002797173105.html).
